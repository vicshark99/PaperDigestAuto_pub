"""LLM-based relevance scoring filter.

This module provides an LLM-based filter for scoring paper relevance.
It uses DeepSeek API to score papers based on their relevance to the lab's research focus.

The LLMFilter class supports:
- Initialization with API key, lab description, and threshold
- Scoring papers in batches to reduce API calls
- Filtering papers by relevance score
- Handling API errors and credit balance issues

The module processes papers in batches of 10 to optimize API usage and includes error handling for API credit exhaustion.
